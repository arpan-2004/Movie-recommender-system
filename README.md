# Movie-recommender-system
The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning-based application designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and the characteristics of movies they enjoy. 
The goal of this project is to build a system that can predict which movies a user would most likely enjoy by analyzing patterns in user behavior and movie features, ultimately enhancing the user experience by offering tailored suggestions.

Key Features:

Personalized Recommendations: The system suggests movies to users based on their historical interactions, preferences, ratings, and viewing habits.

Collaborative Filtering: The recommender system uses collaborative filtering techniques, such as user-based or item-based filtering, to identify movies that similar users have liked. This helps users discover movies they might not have considered based on the preferences of others with similar tastes.

Content-Based Filtering: By analyzing the features of movies, such as genre, actors, director, plot keywords, and language, the system suggests movies that are similar to those the user has rated highly or shown interest in.

Hybrid Recommendation: Combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to leverage the strengths of both methods and improve recommendation accuracy.

Rating Prediction: For users who have not rated a particular movie, the system can predict how likely they are to enjoy it based on their past behavior and the preferences of similar users
